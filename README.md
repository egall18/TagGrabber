# TagGrabber
Main motive in building this project was to be able to understand how Python automation regrading Twitter Bot works.
A Twitter bot is a type of bot software that controls a Twitter account via the Twitter API.
The bot software may autonomously perform actions such as tweeting, re-tweeting, liking, following, unfollowing, or direct messaging other accounts.
I am easily able to update my status, search about anything and retweet that search.
  Pros: Proper usage includes broadcasting helpful information, automatically generating interesting or creative content, and automatically replying to users via direct message.
  Cons: Improper usage includes circumventing API rate limits, violating user privacy, spamming, and sockpuppeting.
I am currently using PythonAnywhere to run my code tweenty four hours a day.
I also used 2 separate twitter accounts for testing purposes.
